# Air Quality Monitor 🫧

This project focuses on analyzing and monitoring **air quality** using both real-time and historical data.  
It provides insights into **pollution levels**, visualizes the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**, and aims to spread awareness about creating a cleaner and healthier environment.

## 🔧 Features

* Data loading and cleaning (handling missing values, fixing data types)
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with clear visualizations
* Correlation analysis (pollutants vs AQI)
* Basic machine learning models for AQI prediction (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
* Exportable plots and reports

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
   .venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies (see above).
4. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `Air_quality.ipynb` and run the cells step by step.

## 📊 Data

* Input format: CSV files with pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO, etc.**
* Place your datasets inside the `data/` folder.
* Update the file path in the notebook (e.g., `data/your_file.csv`).

> If using a public dataset, add the source link here.

## 🧠 Modeling (Optional)

The notebook may include:

* Linear Regression for continuous AQI prediction
* Random Forest Regressor for improved performance
* Train/Test split with evaluation metrics: **MAE, RMSE, R²**

---

## 📦 Results

Document insights and outputs here, such as:

* Key pollutants impacting AQI
* Seasonal or temporal trends
* City-wise comparisons

All generated figures can be stored in the `reports/` folder.
